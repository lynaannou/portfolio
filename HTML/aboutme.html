  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I'm Lyna Annou, a third-year Computer Science student at USTHB, specializing in Artificial Intelligence.  
    With a strong academic foundation—valedictorian of my high school (Math track, 17.19/20) and vice-major of my university class—I'm on track to graduate as an AI engineer in 2027.
  </p>
  <p>
    I work across the stack but lean toward backend development. I’m proficient in C, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, and I regularly use tools like VS Code, GitHub, Figma, and pgAdmin. I’ve developed multiple web apps and 2D games, and I enjoy the balance between logic and creativity in coding.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm fluent in Arabic, French, and English, with C2 certifications in both English and French, and I’m actively studying Italian. My journey includes a technical internship at Naftal, a national AI competition win (DeepMinds), and multiple self-initiated projects—some of which are shared on GitHub.
  </p>
  <p>
    My motivation is rooted in curiosity and growth. I’m passionate about research and aspire to work in an innovation lab. I also love languages, reading political theory, and constantly pushing beyond what’s expected of me.
